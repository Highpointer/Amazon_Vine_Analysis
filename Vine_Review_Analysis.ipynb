I only fill with water and immediately drain and air dry after every hike. I have experienced no altered taste or smells with this simple care. [Use your Nalgene for flavored water and alcohol!]<br />It's best to fill and pack first for ease in an overnight pack, but can still slide in with a full pack. I've had no issues with suction/water flow. Osprey changed the tube size to 1/4&#34;, which is a good thing as it it fits most quick change valves (mine is cut to allow for direct input from my water pump).<br /><br />The knock - the cap. You're going to have issues and it's only a question of when. The twist cap becomes stuck making it so you have to hold the blue plastic clip in order to securely twist the cap into place. I've found using olive oil (any vegetable oil will do)  on a Q-tip to lubricate the cap between the grey and blue part works well. Probably should avoid a synthetic lubricant like WD-40 unless you're feeling adventurous and are okay with your water smelling like your car's last oil change. This is where the old reservoir has it better - the cap on the old one is highly reliable.<br />Overall, it's good and would be 5-star with a better and more reliable cap (I'd prefer not having to take cautious lubricating measures every time I go on overnight trips).<br /><br />As with all resevoirs and water filtration devices, proper care is necessary. Take 3 minutes to pull it out of your pack immediately, drain, insert a paper towel, and then hang to dry. Unless of course you prefer that old musty scent. I do expect better though of Osprey with regard to the cap considering I'm not the only one who has to deal with this issue.|2015-08-31 |\n",

The straw sticks up in the air, costing some aero energy, but you can stick some Velcro on the frame and around the straw and push it down.

He snow skis so he is familiar with the concept, but he hadn't water skied before so we thought that we would begin with this trainer. He got up on his first try starting in shallow water. Took a second run and had another flawless start.

I was recently camping for 2 weeks and this shower was perfect. It allowed me to take a hot shower everyday. I charged it once or twice when I used my car. When charged the pump work well. It never died on me. Some people said it didn't hold a charge. WRONG!!! When I got home a put it in a pot of water to discharge it and it ran for almost 20 minutes.<br />When camping, I never took a 20 minute shower but several 5-6 minute showers almost daily. I definitely recommend this item for all campers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |2015-08-31 |\n",

The only thing to be aware of is that the installation is not very hard, but will most likely require attaching it to a board, before it's attached to the ceiling. There is another option out there that comes with it's own board integrated in, which would make the installation just a little faster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |2015-08-31 |\n",

Each pouch (2) have a drawstring to close it. There's a small cloth for wiping sweat, and a larger towel to do yoga on. The larger mat is non- slip, and when wet it dries very quickly. I like to have wash these abs let them air dry. The pink is really pretty.  The material is kind-of thinner then I thought. But it still gets the job done. Also getting the towels back in the pouch wasnt easy . I had to refold them a few times to get it to fit. But overall I'm happy with this purchase. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |2015-08-31 |\n",

I bought them anyway and am glad that I did. After about 100 of road use one of the pedals did start to creak. All I had to do to fix it we take the axles out and make sure that the bearings were adjusted properly and repacked them with grease. I love these pedals. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that I had to fiddle with them when they were basically new.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |2015-08-31 |\n",

I reviewed those also.  Save yourself money and hassle and buy these instead.<br /><br />These are amazingly great blades!  I feel like I should have paid more for them since they are so comfortable, smooth on the ground, and they don't have the crappy BOA lacing system that plagues many other K2 skates.  I guess time will tell how long these laces will hold up, but they are great so far.  The laces simply draw tight by pulling them up through the tongue.  They stay tight while skating.<br /><br />I was wanting to get a skate with 90+mm wheels (like my old K2s with the cruddy BOA lacing system) because the terrain I skate on is rocky and sandy.  I was pleasantly surprised and how when these glide over imperfect surfaces and resist rocks and debris.  I think that great shape of the skate and how well they fit your feet deserves the credit for the smooth operation.<br /><br />Ergonomically, these are far superior to the Roller Derby skates I returned and I think they are even better than my last 2 pairs of K2 skates simply because once the laces are tight, they are completely out of the way.  The toe box is well padded and a great shape for my average width feet.  The foot strap is effective and comfortable.  The ankle strap is also effective and comfortable.  When these are on your feet and laced up, you don't feel like you have a clunky contraction on your feet.  These feel like an extension of your foot.

This bag is fabulous.  I was looking for something that was not the standard, boring black messenger bag, and this is it!  My laptop fits perfectly - it's a Dell 14&#34;.  I was a bit concerned that one reviewer said that he/she had to slice open the laptop sleeve to get the laptop to fit, but my 14&#34; (with extended battery) fits just fine.  This bag is - in the Goldilocks sense - not too big, not too small, but just right.  It is well-designed, with lots of pockets.  It has a strap across the back that I ended up removing because I don't need it (if you ride a bike with the bag, I guess it would be helpful).  The bag is not black, but more like a charcoal color, if that makes a difference.  It can fit a water bottle, but that takes up some of the internal space because of the way the pocket is designed.  This is not a flaw, but something to note if you carry a water bottle and also want to pack more than a laptop and a few folders or a binder.  If you need to carry more than a laptop and maybe one binder or textbook, you will need a bigger bag, but if you're looking for a stylish way to transport your laptop plus a binder or book, this bag is AWESOME.  Super sturdy, well designed, cool pattern, good padding on the laptop sleeve, and some reflective trim for safety, without looking too &#34;sporty&#34;.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |2015-08-31 |\n",
